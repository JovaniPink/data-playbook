### Example queries

Here are some example queries that you can use to get started:

```sql
# Get all Cloud Audit Logs for data access events for the project with the ID "my-project".
SELECT
  *
FROM
  `cloudaudit_googleapi_com_data_access`
WHERE
  resource.type = 'project'
AND
  resource.name = 'projects/my-project';

# Get all Cloud Audit Logs for data access events by the user with the email address "user@example.com".
SELECT
  *
FROM
  `cloudaudit_googleapi_com_data_access`
WHERE
  authenticationInfo.principalEmail = 'user@example.com';

# Get all Cloud Audit Logs for data access events for the method "storage.objects.get".
SELECT
  *
FROM
  `cloudaudit_googleapi_com_data_access`
WHERE
  methodName = 'storage.objects.get';

# Get all Cloud Audit Logs for data access events between "2023-11-01" and "2023-11-02".
SELECT
  *
FROM
  `cloudaudit_googleapi_com_data_access`
WHERE
  timestamp >= '2023-11-01'
AND
  timestamp <= '2023-11-02';

# Get all Cloud Audit Logs for data access events that resulted in the status code "403".
SELECT
  *
FROM
  `cloudaudit_googleapi_com_data_access`
WHERE
  status.code = 403;

# Get all Cloud Audit Logs for data access events initiated from the IP address "192.168.1.1".
SELECT
  *
FROM
  `cloudaudit_googleapi_com_data_access`
WHERE
  sourceIp = '192.168.1.1';
```

You can also combine these queries to create more complex queries. For example, you could query all Cloud Audit Logs for data access events for a specific resource that were initiated by a specific user and that resulted in a specific status code.

```sql
SELECT
  timestamp,
  logName,
  insertId,
  protopayload_auditlog AS protoPayload,
  protopayload_auditlog.methodName AS methodName,
  protopayload_auditlog.resourceName AS resourceName,
  protopayload_auditlog.metadataJson AS metadata
FROM
  `YOUR_PROJECT.YOUR_DATASET.cloudaudit_googleapis_com_activity`
WHERE
  timestamp >= "2022-01-01"
  AND timestamp < "2022-12-31"
  AND protopayload_auditlog.serviceName="bigquery.googleapis.com"
  AND protopayload_auditlog.methodName = "google.cloud.bigquery.v2.TableService.InsertTable"
ORDER BY
  timestamp DESC
```

1. **Count of Data Access Events by Resource Type**
```sql
SELECT
  protoPayload.resource.type AS resource_type,
  COUNT(*) AS event_count
FROM
  `YOUR_PROJECT_ID.YOUR_DATASET_ID.cloudaudit_googleapi_com_data_access`
GROUP BY
  resource_type
ORDER BY
  event_count DESC;
```

2. **List of Unique Users Accessing Data**
```sql
SELECT DISTINCT
  protoPayload.authenticationInfo.principalEmail AS user_email
FROM
  `YOUR_PROJECT_ID.YOUR_DATASET_ID.cloudaudit_googleapi_com_data_access`;
```

3. **Data Access Events in the Last 7 Days**
```sql
SELECT
  timestamp,
  protoPayload.resource.type AS resource_type,
  protoPayload.methodName AS method,
  protoPayload.authenticationInfo.principalEmail AS user_email
FROM
  `YOUR_PROJECT_ID.YOUR_DATASET_ID.cloudaudit_googleapi_com_data_access`
WHERE
  TIMESTAMP_DIFF(CURRENT_TIMESTAMP(), timestamp, DAY) <= 7
ORDER BY
  timestamp DESC;
```

4. **Top 5 Resources with the Most Data Access Events**
```sql
SELECT
  protoPayload.resource.name AS resource_name,
  COUNT(*) AS event_count
FROM
  `YOUR_PROJECT_ID.YOUR_DATASET_ID.cloudaudit_googleapi_com_data_access`
GROUP BY
  resource_name
ORDER BY
  event_count DESC
LIMIT 5;
```

5. **Data Access Events without Proper Authorization**
```sql
SELECT
  timestamp,
  protoPayload.status.message AS error_message,
  protoPayload.authenticationInfo.principalEmail AS user_email
FROM
  `YOUR_PROJECT_ID.YOUR_DATASET_ID.cloudaudit_googleapi_com_data_access`
WHERE
  protoPayload.status.code != 0
ORDER BY
  timestamp DESC;
```
